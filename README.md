wheres-my-car
=============

A Flask webapp to keep track of where my car is parked.

This leverages the Google Maps API to show a marker where the car is parked. San Francisco street cleaning data was collected from a city source and imported into a db. Click anywhere in San Francisco and see what the street cleaning is for that address.

Designed for mobile web, here's a screenshot of what it looks like:
